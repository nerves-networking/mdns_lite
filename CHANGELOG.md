# CHANGELOG

## v0.6.8

* Improvements
  * Removed the dependency on `DNS`.
  * Remove optional dependency on VintageNet.

## v0.6.7

* Improvements
  * Exclude `"wwan0"` by default. These interfaces are cellular links like ppp
    and it's not appropriate to respond to mDNS on them either.

## v0.6.6

* Bug fixes
  * Advertise services based on service names & not hostname. Thanks to Matt
    Trudel for this fix.

## v0.6.5

* Bug fixes
  * Reuse addresses and ports when binding to the multicast socket to coexist
    with other mDNS software. Thanks to Eduardo Cunha and Matt Myers for the
    updates.

## v0.6.4

* New features
  * Support custom TXT record contents. See the `:txt_payload`. Thanks to
    Eduardo Cunha for adding this.

## v0.6.3

* Bug fixes
  * Update default so that ppp interfaces are ignored. This prevents surprises
    of having a responder run on a cellular link.

## v0.6.2

* Bug fixes
  * Fix crash when handling undecodable mDNS messages

## v0.6.1

* Handle nil from VintageNet reports

## v0.6.0

* Allow mdns host to be change at runtime
* New network monitor: VintageNetMonitor

## v0.2.1
